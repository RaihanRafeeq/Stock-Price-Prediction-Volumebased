Overview:
This project utilizes a Sequential Neural Network (SNN) to predict the next day's stock price movement based on a combination of today's volume, the three-day average volume, and today's closing price. The primary goal is to determine whether the stock price will increase or decrease.

Tools Used:

Data Retrieval: Yahoo Finance API via yfinance library
Data Manipulation: Pandas and NumPy
Machine Learning: TensorFlow and Keras
Data Visualization: Matplotlib

Workflow:

Data Collection:
Fetches historical stock data for a specified stock index (^NSEI in this case) using Yahoo Finance API.

Feature Selection:
Extracts relevant features, including today's volume, three-day average volume, and today's closing price.

Data Preprocessing:
Handles missing data and excludes entries with zero volume.

Target Variable Creation:
Computes the next day's closing price and determines the target variable (result) based on a set condition.

Model Building:
Constructs a Sequential Neural Network (SNN) with two dense layers.
Utilizes the sigmoid activation function for both layers and binary crossentropy loss for binary classification.

Model Training:
Splits the dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
Trains the model on the training set, validating on the testing set for 20 epochs.

Evaluation:
Visualizes the training and testing accuracy and loss over epochs.
Computes and displays the model's accuracy on the testing set.

Conclusion:
This project aims to predict stock price movements, providing insights into potential market trends. The Sequential Neural Network leverages historical data to make predictions, with the training process and evaluation metrics illustrating its performance. Users can further explore and refine the model for enhanced accuracy and applicability in real-world stock market scenarios.
